Jez Humble argues that *Mission Control* is the key to understanding how big enterprises can maneuver in scale and compete with startups.

It is about defining a shared set of intents and goals for the employees and providing them with enough freedom to *"act decisively and autonomously"* to achieve that goal rather than detailed upfront planning. This approach makes sense in a complex system where everything is volatile and plans should be refined constantly.

> ...circumstances change very rapidly, and it is rare indeed for directions which cover a long period of time in a lot of detail to be fully carried out... not commanding more than is strictly necessary, nor planning beyond the circumstances you can foresee ... The higher the level of command, the shorter and more general the orders should be. The next level down should
add whatever further specifcation it feels to be necessary, and the details of execution are left to verbal instructions or perhaps a word of command. This ensures that everyone retains freedom of movement and decision within the bounds of their authorityâ€¦The rule to follow is that an order should contain all, but also only, what subordinates cannot determine for themselves to achieve a particular purpose

The key is to make sure `orders always include a passage which describes their intent, communicating the purpose of the orders`. For more information, please refer to [Lean Enterprise Book Excerpt](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/leanenterprise/lean_enterprise_excerpt.pdf).
