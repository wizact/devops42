Based on a study by Westrum<sup>[[1]]</sup>, a culture is defined as the organisation’s pattern of response to the problems and opportunities it encounters. He classifies ogrnasiation culture into three dominant types:

- Pathological, that focuses on personal needs,
- Bureaucratic, that focuses on departmental turf,
- and Generative that focuses on the mission

What shapes the difference in these organisations is how freely information can flow to help with appropriate response.

How organisations process information<sup>[[1]]</sup>

| Pathological             | Bureaucratic            | Generative           |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Power oriented           | Rule oriented           | Performance oriented |
| Low cooperation          | Modest cooperation      | High cooperation     |
| Messengers shot          | Messengers neglected    | Messengers trained   |
| Responsibilities shirked | Narrow Responsibilities | Risks are shared     |
| Bridging discouraged     | Bridging tolerated      | Bridging encouraged  |
| Failure scapegoating     | Failure justice         | Failure inquiry      |
| Novelty crushed          | Novelty problems        | Novelty implemented  |

In a nutshell, it seems like the whole company should focus on *"getting the right information to the right people by any means necessary" proactively*.

Moreover, the three variables that shapes the information flow climate are:
- Alignment,
- Awareness,
- and Empowerment.

Based on the same study, in a generative organisation:

> Alignment takes place through identification with the mission. The individual “buys into” what he or she is supposed to do and its effect on the outcome. A sense of ownership is a natural consequence of identification with the leaders and the team. Accordingly this person will try harder for and care more about the outcome.

> Awareness comes when there are conscious efforts to keep team members informed about all the variables that affect their efforts. These efforts are most strenuous in generative organisations.

> Empowerment is required for maximum performance. Individuals’ minds are harnessed to fulfill the organisation’s goals through a culture of conscious inquiry. They are encouraged to speak up, think outside the box, and to act as fully conscious participants in a great cooperative enterprise.
